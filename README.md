The purpose of this repository is to mainly learn more about GIT and GITHUB but also having a little bit of fun while I do it.
Downloading GIT was easy, my main problem was, for 30 minutes I was wondering why it was trying to upload all my Appdata in my User File in windows. 
That's when I realized I had not set a Directory (IE my Webpage file) after correcting that mistake, everything was smooth sailing from there.
